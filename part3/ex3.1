Here's the repo that now has a deployment pipeline to Heroku:

https://github.com/jonkur/Kysymyspankki

A push to master branch will trigger a new image being created and then pushed to
Heroku container registry and then released, see main.yml. No image is created on Dockerhub as that
was not a requirement given by the task.
