Image sizes before Dockerfile changes:
example-frontend: 490MB
example-backend:  1.01GB

Image sizes after Dockerfile changes:
example-frontend: 446MB
example-backend:  348MB

Further explanation:
For example-backend, I was using the golang 1.16 base image before the changes, which caused the image to become 1GB large.
Both images could probably have been trimmed even further by removing more unnecessary packages, but this will have to suffice for now.
The app is not fully functioning using these images alone since there is no image for database or redis included.
