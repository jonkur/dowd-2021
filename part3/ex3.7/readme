In this exercise I have optimized the docker image for the project I dockerized in ex 3.1

The old Dockerfile is in this same folder by the name Dockerfile.old
The old image size was 628MB.

The new Dockerfile is also in the same folder.
After building, the new image size is 77.6MB. Most of that is taken up by the custom JRE containing only the
Java libraries that this app is dependent on.
It is about 50MB smaller than I could make it with any of the ready-made JRE images I could find on Docker hub.
The new image also has a non-root user active while running the app, for added security.

Build in this folder with 
docker build -t kysymyspankki:alpine .

And run with
docker run -p 4567:4567 kysymyspankki:alpine
