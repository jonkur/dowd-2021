Both frontend and backend are now using multi-stage builds. See Dockerfiles in their respective folders.
Everything works flawlessly with the new images, use

docker-compose up --build

in this folder to make sure the new, small images are running. Frontend should now be running at localhost:80

Image sizes after multi-stage building:
example-frontend =  24.4MB
example-backend  =  18MB

Frontend uses alpine nginx server base image, backend is built using an empty scratch image.
