# To start the devopsdoceruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu container mapped to the host machine port 8080 (that port must be free!), the cmd is:
docker run -p 8080:8080 devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu server

# Navigating to localhost:8080 in the browser should now result in a response from that server
